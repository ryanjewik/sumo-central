A sensible “grow from 1→3 brokers” path

Add two brokers (set proper advertised.listeners).

Increase RF for important topics (e.g., to 3).

Run partition reassignment to spread partitions across all 3 brokers (with throttle).

Increase partitions on hot topics if you need more consumer parallelism/throughput.

Run leader rebalancing so leadership is evenly distributed.

Tune retention & monitor disk/network during the copy.

Quick command sketch (conceptual)
# 1) Create a reassignment JSON for topics (brokers: [1,2,3])
kafka-reassign-partitions --generate --topics-to-move-json-file topics.json --broker-list "1,2,3"

# 2) Execute reassignment
kafka-reassign-partitions --execute --reassignment-json-file proposed.json --throttle 104857600

# 3) Bump replication factor (Kafka 3.x supports kafka-alter-topic RF change)
kafka-alter-topic --topic my_topic --partitions 12   # if you need more partitions
# Then use reassignment to place replicas and set RF=3, or use the dedicated RF change APIs.

# 4) Preferred leader election
